/**
 * Long-term memory, through Honcho (honcho.dev). Each workspace has a memory bank (a Honcho
 * workspace) that its bots share: the user's card (who they are, their projects, their people) and what
 * Honcho has learned about them. The first workspace uses the user's existing bank (from .env.local,
 * maybe shared with their other agents), so bots know them from day one; a new workspace starts with
 * a fresh bank unless they share one or copy what's known about them into it. Every chat and finished task goes back into
 * Honcho, so it keeps learning. If Honcho is slow or down, a turn goes ahead without it.
 *
 * Jev (decide.ts) keeps it clean: it notices when the user says something worth remembering, checks a
 * new fact against what's known (a repeat is skipped, one that replaces an older fact offers to
 * forget it), keeps private lines out of prompts, finds facts that were learned wrong, and tells
 * personal facts from work ones when they copy memory between workspaces.
 *
 * Signed in with Orgo, Honcho is reached through Bops Cloud (lib/server/cloud.ts), and every bank
 * there carries the user's own prefix (bankFor).
