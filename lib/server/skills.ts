 *
 * - Its apps: the accounts the user gave it, each by name with read only or read & act, straight
 *   from the user's connected accounts (any app in Composio's catalog, so Google Sheets, Notion,
 *   HubSpot or Jira show up as soon as they're connected), how to use them through the app gateway

 *   user's other connected apps it can't use yet. Never the Slack connection (CHANNEL_APPS): it's
 *   how bots get into Slack, and Slack is listed with the places.
 * - Where the user reaches it: Bops, texts and calls on its number, email, and the Slack, Telegram and
 *   Discord it was added to (channels.ts), with what a message from there looks like and where the
 *   answer goes.
