/**
 * Who may call Bops' API. The server answers on every address the Mac has, but only the app on this
 * Mac may drive it: anyone else on the same wifi could otherwise sign it out and back in to their own
 * Orgo account, and any web page in the user's browser could post to it.
 *
 * - A request addressed to another host (a LAN or tailnet address, or a DNS-rebound name) may only
 *   reach the paths the tailnet calls, each of which proves itself (the bot's secret, the webhook
 *   signature): bot computers' app calls and the webhook relay (edge/).
 * - A request from a web page must come from the app's own origin.
 *
 * The Host header is the caller's to set, so this stops browsers, not a determined caller on the
 * same network. That needs the server bound to loopback, and then another way in for the tailnet
 * paths above.
 *
 * A hosted server (BOPS_DATABASE_URL) is reached by its own name, so that name is the app's too:
 * BOPS_PUBLIC_HOST lists it (names, comma separated; behind a reverse proxy that rewrites Host, the
 * public name the browser uses). Without it, a hosted server takes any Host and keeps the origin check.
