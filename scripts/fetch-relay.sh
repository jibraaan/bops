# Fetches the relay agent (orgo-relay) that routes the bots' computers through this Mac
# (lib/server/relay.ts), checks it against the release's SHA256SUMS, and puts it at
# vendor/orgo-relay/orgo-relay-<arm64|x64>, which the packaged app of that arch bundles (and points
# BOPS_RELAY_BIN at). The one for this Mac's arch is also vendor/orgo-relay/orgo-relay, where the
# dev server finds it.
#
# The version is pinned: keep it at what Orgo's ORGO_RELAY_VERSION expects (orgo-web
# envs/<env>/web-public.env). The repo is private for now, so this needs `gh` signed in to GitHub
# with access to orgoai/orgo-relay.
#
# Usage: scripts/fetch-relay.sh [version] [arch]     e.g. scripts/fetch-relay.sh v0.0.3 x64
